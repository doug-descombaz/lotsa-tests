# Lotsa Tests

The goal of this is to create a repository of tests that can be applied to popular (or unpopular) algorithms. The use case would allow for individual implementations to be tested against a common core of tests.

I would expect that the tests would generally would test for correctness, performance, and/or memory consumption. 

Obviously, because APIs may not be consistent across implementation, extracting the resuable portions of a test, and allowing for individual test executables to wrap the reusable components makes sense.
